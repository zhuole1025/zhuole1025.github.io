## About Me

I am currently working as a young researcher at Shanghai AI Lab after receiving my B.E. degree in 2024, supervised by Dr. [Peng Gao](https://gaopengcuhk.github.io/) and Prof. [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). Before this, I was a research intern at [Mila - Qu√©bec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) supervised by Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). During my undergraduate years, I was supervised by  Prof. [Si Liu](http://colalab.net/) and I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Shuicheng Yan](https://yanshuicheng.info/) and Dr. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence. 
<!-- I was also a research intern at Alibaba Inc., where I worked on music generation with Dr. [Aixi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=hNTP47EAAAAJ&hl=en). -->

## Research Interests

<!-- My interests spans multiple areas, including: -->

- **Generative Modeling:** Broad families of generative models and their potential applications, e.g., diffusion models, flow matching, etc.
- **Multimodal Learning:** Developing models that seamlessly integrate and bridge the gap between various modalities, such as text, image, and audio.
<!-- - **AI4Science:** Exploring ways to make deep learning algorithms more robust to common challenges in drug discovery, e.g., protein understanding, molecular generation, etc. -->
